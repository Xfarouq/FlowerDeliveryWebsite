        <h3>Our Founder's Passion </h3>
        <p>
          Kyiv LuxeBouquets was founded in 2010 by Natalia Zelinska with the
          goal of bringing unique and exquisite bouquets to the people of Kyiv.
          Natalia has always had a passion for flowers and design, and his
          vision was to create a local floral studio that would specialize in
          the creation and delivery of fresh, beautiful, and distinctive
          bouquets.
